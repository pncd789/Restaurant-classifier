# Restaurant-classifier
Using a dataset on restaurants found on Zomato, I predicted whether a restaurant would receive a rating of 3.5 or higher.

Files:

* Zomato_restaurant_classifier.ipynb - Contains the code I wrote to clean and analyze the dataset. THis includes data exploration, data cleaning, visualization, feature creation, and finally using a classifier to predict whether a restaurant would receive a rating of 3.5/5 or higher.
* Restaurant dashboard.pbix - Contains a 3 page power BI dashboard for visualization and further analysis on the restaurants.
* Restaurant_pdf.pdf - Contains a pdf copy of the power BI dashboard.
